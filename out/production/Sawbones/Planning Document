Object class:

Runner (SawbonesRunner)
Maybe a separate object class for limited use and dice?
Probably "borrow" my old string classes project for some of this

Variables:
Level
Attributes
Inventory
Skill Proficiencies
Armor Proficiency
Armor Scaling
Hitpoints
Stamina
Race
Racial Features
Feats
Class
Specializations
Class Features
All of these need to be changeable

Methods:
No parameter constructor, or just one with a name? Name and class with level?
Change / override any and all variables
Roll dice
Roll checks
Limited use Slots
Actions
Turn order
Combat (Use turn order), end at any time, can kill off enemies from turn order
Able to be cleared

Runner class:
Asks for stats, inventory, etc etc
Loop it to ask for what you want to do? (start combat, add items)

This is a lot to do
